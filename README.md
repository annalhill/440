1. What Is Interactive Performance?
   - Agents- artist, artwork, audience
      - flow of communication:
        - reactive system vs. interactive system
        - 2 agents that are able to interact and engage with other agents.
      - Performance:
        - Music, Theatre, Dance, Circus, Sports (Social Media)
      - Interaction
      - Human and Computer, Artist is the Performer, Audience is the Performer, Tech and Tech, Interpersonal Interactions and Media (Accidental/ Intentional)

#### 1/23
1. Live Media: Interactive Technology and Theatre Notes
    - Interactivity -> Live
      - "Sounds and images stored that will produce a response in a live performer's actions"
    - Linear media? </i> -> devices (cd, vcr, etc.) -> Reactive systems
    - 1. Random Access: The use of various inputs and outputs and being able to have control and manipulation over the content.
    - 2. Trigger and Output: Coordinated control of multiple media elements.
      -> Inputs and outputs (aka mapping) -> many to many, many to one, one to one
    - 3. Media Manipulation: Manipulation and the relation of variables to "paint" a picture or experience. The participants ability to create change.
    - Performance with constraints
    - Strengths of both live performance and media -> the intangible relations of how live vs. personal tech experiences formulate different feelings or emotions towards a performance or moment
    - A more meaningful interactive performance between the performer and the audience.
    - Incorporating media without compromising the spontaneity of live Performance
    - Agents- Performers, Technology
    - Outside Agents- Audience

1. Interactivity and Liveness in Electro- acoustic Concert Music by Mike Frengel
- The concept and interaction of electrical facilitators and their ability to interact and control or react to live performance.
- Agents: Live performance, electronics, and spectators
- Attributes of live performance:
  1. Virtuosity: Outstanding performance that is beyond the norm. Mastery of motor and musical language. The control and combination
    - of such mastery skills provide an enticing and perceptually overwhelming experience.
  2. Fallibility: Mythos. The ability to fail and literally fall is a characteristic to liv performance that makes it human and has the
    audience sitting on the edge of their seat waiting to watch this obstacle being overcome.
  3. Spontaneous Variability: The evolution and individual characteristics each artist/ performer brings forth.
    - The influence of visual cues: Working with music in particular, the ability to create a story and mimic the storyline or the music to create a
      succinct performance. All of the above factors placed into a performance, allow for the appeal of live performance. The process produces
      a product whether that be a good or bas reaction. Overall, live performance alone is visually, mentally and physically stimulating and when you add a factor in such as electronics, adds to the works complexity and also adds another stimulating factor in, "how'd- they- do- it?".
  4. Presence: </i> "physical co-presence of performers and audience; temporal simultaneity and reception; experience in the moment" (Frengel, 2)
    "how'd- they- do- it?": A shift of attention towards function and allowing a spectator to see and understand the "human- machine interaction".
  5. Electroacoustic:
    - Typically don't involve a live performer on stage
    - What can be gained when sound sources and mechanics cannot be seen?
    - When performers are involved, a lot of coordination has to take place as there is highly limited flexibility.
    - Electroacoustic music tries to free the performer from these constraints.
  6. The Instrumental Model:
    - The use of an instrument to create a more organic process, product interaction. This provides a certain level of consistency
    - as well to help develop, express, and react.

Understanding Interactive Systems by Jon Drummond
Interactive defines a reactive system that includes an audience or participation in some manner.

Introduction
1. Combining mediums and being able to work among similar artists to create new and exciting pieces.
2. The ability to provide experiences for an assortment of audiences, musical and non- musical.
3. Interactive music systems used in a variety of systems.

Definitions
1. Traditional roles in interactive composition?
2. Shared processes and products- human and machine interactions.
3. Musical Output as a result of shared interactions.

Classifications and Models
1. Intention and use.

System Anatomy
1. Sensing, processing, and response


### 1/29
In class notes
Genres are important because they give us a form of communication in a topic we can't quite evaluate on a normal scale.
A reactive and interactive system that uses the agents of Performance, Audience and technology to create an experience or painting.
Trying to effect state changes in another agent (at least two agent).

Dr. Musick's definitions:

1. Interactive: A system, with at least two agents, who have an equal oppurtunity of effecting state changes in every other agent.
2. Reactive: A one- way sharing of information, with the goal of changing something else.
3. Dynamical:
4. System: Some sort of organized group of things, that do something.
5. Liveness: The perception of whether something is actually occuring in real- time? (i.e. the email problem)

A tool vs. Instrument -- What is technology?
What is a visual instrument?

Types of Systems:
Interactive System Models:
1. The instrumental model: Reactive system, something that a performer understands its possible outputs.
2. The conductor model: Moderator of output information, typically includes fixed- media, controls timing, not at the micro- level of the instrument.
3. The reflexive model: Starting to introduce true agency, responds to something at the input, may make it's own choices, however, still expected results.
4. The virtual performer model: working towards full agency.

System Design Terms
1. Affordance:
2. Constraints:
3. Agency:


# Personal Notes and Research

## 1/23
Interactive Performance Examples:

[Example]("./images/empsr.jpg")

An example of interactive performance is the Experience Music Project in Seattle, WA.
In this large crafted piece of art, the experience is designed and left up to the participant. Whether the participant chooses to
react to the music playing in the main hall or experiment with the sound design room where one or more people can play with
instruments and record their own tracks is their personal choice. No matter what the decision, their participation will produce their
outcome and make every participants experience within the interactive performance exhibit different.

Agents: Participants and Instruments

# Projects

#### Project 1
#### Reactive Letters

1. In this project I am looking to create a sound interactive blackboard. In it, based upon amplitude and/ or frequency, you will be able to make letters react and show up on the screen within a sound wave.
2. As an interactive performance, this piece allows the visuals to react to whatever the performer is saying, yelling, singing, or playing.
3. Agents/ Technology: Computer, Microphone, Processing, Performers

Related work:
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmmTA9N5ySw - In this basic production, the word is reacting to music playing. It was built in after effects but the audio input to the system allows the word to "jump".
    - https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/500150 - This project is using color changing colors, could be applied to an audio reactive process


#### Project 2
#### Sound Poetry:
- Launch: Wednesday, February 21st
- Sketch due: Wednesday, February 28th
- Project due: Wednesday, March 14th
- Documentation due: Monday, March 19th

 1. In this project, I will be building upon my sketch of taking in amplitude ratings from a microphone (stereo) and outputting it in the form of words. Depending on what level of amplitude comes into the system, the sketch will "upload" a word and as you begin using different voices and sounds, the sketch will create a flow of words. Sometimes your poetry will make sense, and other times the words will come out in very random and unreadable manners.The main concept of this is that you'll be creating your own structure and as you figure out,
as the performer, what sounds make certain words and levels, you can structure your own poetry or sentences.
2. In a live performance or interactive performance capacity, this project could be used to tell a story, program the words to certain sounds. If an instrumental only performer were
to play this sketch along with their music, the input of sound would create the lyrics that go to the song.
3. Agents/ Technology: Processing Sketch, Microphone (could be from the computer or external- depends on resources), and performers (myself or classmates).

This is a copy of the code that I am building off of

```
import ddf.minim.*;
AudioPlayer player;
Minim minim;

void setup(){
  size(1400, 1200, P2D);

  minim = new Minim(this);
  player = minim.loadFile("./p1_practice_1.wav", 2048);
  player.play();
  player.loop();
}

void draw(){
  background(0);
  stroke(255);
  line(0,200,width,200);
  int count = 0;
  int lowTot = 0;
  int medTot = 0;
  int hiiTot = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < player.left.size()/3.0; i+=5){
    lowTot+= (abs(player.left.get(i)) * 10 );
    count++;
  }
  fill( map( lowTot, 0, count * 50, 0, 255 ), 0, 0);
  noStroke();
  text("A",0,0,40,40);
  stroke(255);
  strokeWeight(2);

  for (int i = 0; i < player.left.size()/3.0; i+=5){
    medTot+= (abs(player.left.get(i)) * 5 );
    count++;
  }
  fill( map( medTot, 0, count * 50, 0, 255 ), 0, 0);
  noStroke();
  text("B", 0,0,60,60);
  stroke(245);
  strokeWeight(2);

  <for (int i = 0; i < player.left.size()/3.0; i+=5){
    hiiTot+= (abs(player.left.get(i)) * 30 );
    count++;
  }
  fill( map( hiiTot, 0, count * 50, 0, 255 ), 0, 0);
  noStroke();
  text("C", 0,0,50,50);
  stroke(120);
  strokeWeight(2);

  for (int i = 0; i < player.left.size()-1; i+=5)
  {
    line(i, 50 + player.left.get(i)*50, i+1, 50 + player.left.get(i+1)*50);
    line(i, 150 + player.right.get(i)*50, i+1, 150 + player.right.get(i+1)*50);
    point( 2*i, 100 + player.left.get(i)*50 );


void stop(){
  player.close();
  minim.stop();
  super.stop();
  ```

## Title: Reactive interactions
## Date: April 25, 2018: 6/7 PM
### University of Montana Interactive Performance Spring 2018

1. Related Works:
I really wanted to find as many works out there as I could to inspire me not only in visual aesthetics but also what I am capable of creating in P5.js, a relatively new program for me. Luckily, there are a lot of open source resources out there for me to reference. Below are a few of the sources I've explored and what intrigued me about them as well as what I would take away from them to incorporate in my own visualizer.

- B Lack, Open Processing P5.js Sketch, Circular Processing Network, September 25, 2013, Visited April 14, 2018
https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/111888
- Tina Anastopoulos, P5.js sketch, Fan Loader, Visited April 10, 2018
https://www.kode.to/TWAIN/fan-loader-mWjPKm
- Nairako, Visualization art using p5.js based on the sound of waves at Yuigahama 1 of 2, November 7, 2015, Visited April 16, 2018
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBPAtibRb1E

2. Initial Goals:
Brainstorming going into the project:
- My first idea is to continue with Project two and expand upon the word bank that I was creating for the project, Sound Poetry. This would mean expanding the number of words that I can input into the system as well as creating a more visually inviting display.
- The second idea I am adapting from Week 8 in the Creative Coding class. In the lesson we worked with loops and visual effects based on if, else statements. I would like to continue working with sound input and the ways it can alter and affect visuals.

Ideas as I start project three:
- Visualizer
- Use of colors and movement to create an interesting and dynamic Project
- Working in P5.js
- Use of shapes to guide the visuals
  - Art inside of various shapes?
  - Use of shapes to create an entire composition?
  - "Drawing"?

3. Final Goals and Concept:
The idea behind this project was simply to try and find a visual aid for audio input via beat detection, and amplitude scale. The project initially was going to react to the performer and their choice of performance but the idea has developed into how communication between technology and human interaction can influence each other. One way to do this is to take the performer and have them play whatever they want with the visual components playing behind them, this would involve very little interaction. The better idea is to have the performer and the screen looking at each other. The program will continuously be listening to the audio input and reacting to the sounds it's intaking. On the other side, the performer will be watching the visuals and reacting to them. If there are lighter colors, maybe play a softer sound, darker colors, a heavier sound, etc.

4. Draft Notes:
Some things that I need to consider before the final presentation...
- Run through with performers so they know how the performance will go
- Microphone to speakers to project the performers voices
- How will the project be introduced
- How will the performance come to an end
  - Cue for performers to stop
  - return to black screen
