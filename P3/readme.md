# MART 440- Project 3

#### Ideas:
1. My first idea is to continue with Project two and expand upon the word bank that I was creating for the project, Sound Poetry. This would mean expanding the number of words that I can input into the system as well as creating a more visually inviting display. 
2. The second idea I am adapting from Week 8 in the Creative Coding class. In the lesson we worked with loops and visual effects based on if, else statements. I would like to continue working with sound input and the ways it can alter and affect visuals.
